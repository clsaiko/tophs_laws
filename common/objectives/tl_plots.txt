# Plot tags need to start with 'plot_'

# Supported types:
# character, spouse, rivals, friends, liege_titles, vassal_titles, realm_titles, realm_characters, realm_characters_plus, independent_rulers
# Special: society_plot. When trigger fulfilled, anyone within the society can be invited. ROOT is the plotter. FROM is the target. FROMFROM is the society
# Note that "player_allow" has the target as ROOT, and the plotter (the player) as FROM!
